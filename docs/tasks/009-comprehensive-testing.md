## Progress Updates

### 2025-10-26 - Architect
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task created based on PRD requirements
**Blockers**: Depends on completion of all feature tasks
**Next Steps**: Wait for all feature implementation before comprehensive testing

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

Comprehensive testing is essential for ensuring the reliability and security of the expense management system. The testing strategy should cover all layers of the application and focus on critical business logic.

Key considerations:
- Use transactional testing for database operations
- Mock external dependencies (email services, etc.)
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios
- Ensure tests are maintainable and readable
- Focus on testing business logic rather than implementation details
- Use realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure tests run quickly in CI/CD pipeline
