The review workflow is critical for maintaining policy compliance while providing flexibility for edge cases. It should be efficient for reviewers while providing transparency to expense submitters.

Key considerations:
- Review assignment should be fair and efficient
- Reviewers need all necessary context to make decisions
- Audit trail must be complete for compliance
- Notifications should be timely but not overwhelming
- Consider bulk review operations for efficiency
- Review interface should be mobile-friendly
- Need to handle reviewer unavailability (vacation, etc.)
- Review decisions should be clearly communicated to submitters
