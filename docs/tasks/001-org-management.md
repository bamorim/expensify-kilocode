## Description

Implemented the Organization Management feature including database schema, tRPC API endpoints, and React UI components. This feature allows users to create new organizations and serves as the foundation for the multi-tenant expense management system. Includes the UserOrganization membership model to establish proper user-organization relationships from the start.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Created Organization model with id, name, slug, and timestamps
- Created UserOrganization model for many-to-many relationship with roles (ADMIN/MEMBER)
- Added proper indexes for organization and membership queries
- Created database migration: `20251026193326_add_organization_models`
- Added constraints to prevent duplicate memberships

### API Implementation
- Created organization tRPC router with procedures:
  - `createOrganization`: Creates new organization and assigns admin role to creator
  - `getOrganization`: Retrieves organization details (requires membership)
  - `getUserOrganizations`: Lists all organizations for current user
  - `updateOrganization`: Updates organization details (admin only)
  - `getOrganizationMembers`: Lists all members of an organization
- Added proper input validation with Zod schemas
- Implemented organization access controls in procedures

### Authentication Updates
- Simplified NextAuth configuration to remove organization context from session
- Adopted URL-based organization selection approach for multi-tab support
- Users can now access different organizations via URLs

### UI Components
- Created organization creation form with validation
- Created organization list component with role indicators
- Created organization detail page with edit functionality
- Created organization members list with user avatars
- Added organization management to main navigation
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states

### Testing
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all tRPC procedures
- Tested organization creation, retrieval, and update operations
- Tested membership validation and role-based access controls
- Tested error scenarios and edge cases

## Implementation Summary

The Organization Management feature has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. **Database Schema**: Created Organization and UserOrganization models with proper relationships and indexes
2. **API Layer**: Implemented comprehensive tRPC router with all required procedures and access controls
3. **Authentication**: Simplified auth configuration for URL-based organization selection
4. **UI Components**: Created complete set of components for organization management
5. **Testing**: Implemented comprehensive test suite using transactional testing pattern

All acceptance criteria have been met and the implementation provides a solid foundation for the multi-tenant expense management system.

## Completion Checklist

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Code follows project standards
- [x] Tests written and passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code review completed

## Notes

This is the foundational feature for the entire system. All subsequent features will depend on proper organization management and data isolation. By including the UserOrganization membership model in this task, we established the proper foundation for role-based access control throughout the application.

Key considerations:
- Organization creator automatically becomes admin via UserOrganization
- Users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles
- All business data must be organization-scoped
- URL-based organization selection allows for multi-tab workflows
- Role information is available for authorization checks
- Organization invitation workflow will be implemented in next task (TASK-003)

## Architecture Decision

During implementation, we made a key decision to use URL-based organization selection instead of session-based selection. This allows users to have multiple tabs open with different organizations, providing a more versatile multi-org setup. The organization ID is passed through URL parameters and included in tRPC calls that require organization context.
