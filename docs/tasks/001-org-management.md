## Description

Implement the Organization Management feature including database schema, tRPC API endpoints, and React UI components. This feature allows users to create new organizations and serves as the foundation for the multi-tenant expense management system. Includes the UserOrganization membership model to establish proper user-organization relationships from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Organization model created in Prisma schema with proper fields
- [ ] UserOrganization model created for many-to-many relationship with roles

- [ ] Organization creator automatically becomes admin via UserOrganization
- [ ] React components for organization creation and management
- [ ] Organization selection UI for users with multiple orgs
- [ ] Proper organization-scoped data access controls
- [ ] Tests for all organization operations

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

This is the foundational feature for the entire system. All subsequent features will depend on proper organization management and data isolation. By including the UserOrganization membership model in this task, we establish the proper foundation for role-based access control throughout the application.

Key considerations:
- Organization creator should automatically become admin via UserOrganization
- Users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles
- All business data must be organization-scoped
- Need proper UI for organization switching
- Role information should be available in the session for authorization
- Consider organization invitation workflow (next task)
