## Notes

Categories are a foundational element for the expense system. They need to be properly scoped to organizations and integrated with both policy management and expense submission workflows.

Key considerations:
- Categories must be organization-scoped for data isolation
- Only admins should be able to manage categories
- Need to handle category deletion carefully (expenses may reference them)
- Categories should have a clean, intuitive UI for management
- Consider providing default categories for new organizations
- Category names should be unique within an organization
