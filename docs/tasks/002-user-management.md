## Description

Enhance the existing User Management system to build upon the UserOrganization model created in Task 1. This task focuses on implementing role-based permissions, advanced user management features, and improving the authentication context with richer organization information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Role-based access control middleware implemented throughout the application
- [x] Enhanced authentication context with current organization and role
- [x] tRPC procedures for advanced user role management
- [x] UI for viewing and managing organization members with role changes
- [x] Proper authorization enforcement for all protected operations
- [x] User profile enhancements showing organizations and roles
- [x] Tests for all enhanced user management operations

## TODOs

### API Implementation
- [x] Enhance user management tRPC router
- [x] Implement updateUserRole procedure (admin only)
- [x] Implement removeUserFromOrganization procedure (admin only)
- [x] Add role-based authorization middleware for all procedures
- [x] Update existing procedures to enforce role permissions

### Authentication Enhancements
- [x] Enhance NextAuth configuration with richer organization context
- [x] Improve session management with multiple organization support
- [x] Implement organization switching with proper role validation
- [x] Add role-based UI rendering helpers

### UI Components
- [x] Enhance organization members list with role management
- [x] Create role management interface for admins
- [x] Update user profile to show all organizations and roles

- [x] Implement permission-based UI element visibility

### Role-Based Access Control
- [x] Define role permissions matrix (Admin vs Member)
- [x] Implement authorization middleware for tRPC procedures
- [x] Create client-side authorization helpers
- [x] Add role checks to all protected UI components

### Integration Points
- [x] Ensure role permissions work with all existing features
- [x] Update organization switching to handle role changes
- [x] Integrate with upcoming invitation system

### Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for enhanced user management procedures
- [x] Write integration tests for role-based access control
- [x] Test organization switching with different roles
- [x] Test permission enforcement in UI components

## Progress Updates

### 2025-10-26 - Architect
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task updated to build upon UserOrganization model from Task 1
**Blockers**: Depends on TASK-001 completion
**Next Steps**: Wait for Organization Management implementation

### 2025-10-26 - Code

**Progress**: All implementation subtasks completed successfully
**Blockers**: None
**Next Steps**: Documentation update and final verification

## Completion Checklist

- [x] Code follows project standards
- [x] Tests written and passing
- [x] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [x] Code review completed

## Notes

This task builds upon the foundation established in Task 1 where the UserOrganization model was created. The focus here was on implementing the business logic around roles and permissions rather than database schema changes.

Key considerations:
- UserOrganization model already exists from Task 1
- Focus on implementing role-based business logic and UI
- Ensure consistent permission enforcement across the application
- Make role management intuitive for organization admins
- Consider audit logging for role changes
- Plan for future role expansion (more granular permissions)

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Role-Based Access Control System**
   - Defined comprehensive permissions matrix in [`src/server/permissions.ts`](src/server/permissions.ts:7)
   - Implemented authorization middleware in [`src/server/api/trpc.ts`](src/server/api/trpc.ts:171)
   - Created client-side authorization helpers in [`src/lib/authorization.ts`](src/lib/authorization.ts:1)

2. **User Management API**
   - Enhanced user management router with role management procedures in [`src/server/api/routers/user-management.ts`](src/server/api/routers/user-management.ts:1)
   - Implemented `updateUserRole` procedure for changing user roles
   - Implemented `removeUserFromOrganization` procedure for removing users
   - Added protection against removing the last admin

3. **UI Components**
   - Enhanced organization members component with role management in [`src/app/_components/organization-members.tsx`](src/app/_components/organization-members.tsx:1)
   - Updated user profile to show organizations and roles in [`src/app/_components/user-profile.tsx`](src/app/_components/user-profile.tsx:1)
   - Implemented permission-based UI rendering with guard components

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for user management procedures in [`src/server/api/routers/user-management.test.ts`](src/server/api/routers/user-management.test.ts:1)
   - Integration tests for RBAC in [`src/server/api/rbac.test.ts`](src/server/api/rbac.test.ts:1)
   - Organization switching tests in [`src/server/api/organization-switching.test.ts`](src/server/api/organization-switching.test.ts:1)
   - Authorization helper tests in [`src/lib/authorization.test.ts`](src/lib/authorization.test.ts:1)
   - Edge case tests in [`src/server/api/edge-cases.test.ts`](src/server/api/edge-cases.test.ts:1)

### Key Features Delivered

1. **Role Management**
   - Admins can promote members to admin role
   - Admins can demote other admins to member role (if not the last admin)
   - Protection against removing the last admin from an organization
   - Users can view their roles in all organizations

2. **Permission Enforcement**
   - All protected operations require appropriate permissions
   - Role-based UI element visibility
   - Consistent authorization checks across all procedures

3. **Multi-Organization Support**
   - Users can have different roles in different organizations
   - Role permissions are respected per organization
   - Seamless organization switching with role preservation
