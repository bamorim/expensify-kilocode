## Description

Enhance the existing User Management system to build upon the UserOrganization model created in Task 1. This task focuses on implementing role-based permissions, advanced user management features, and improving the authentication context with richer organization information.

- [ ] Proper authorization enforcement for all protected operations
- [ ] User profile enhancements showing organizations and roles
- [ ] Tests for all enhanced user management operations

## TODOs

### API Implementation
- [ ] Enhance user management tRPC router
- [ ] Implement updateUserRole procedure (admin only)
- [ ] Implement removeUserFromOrganization procedure (admin only)
- [ ] Add role-based authorization middleware for all procedures
- [ ] Update existing procedures to enforce role permissions

### Authentication Enhancements
- [ ] Enhance NextAuth configuration with richer organization context
- [ ] Improve session management with multiple organization support

- [ ] Create client-side authorization helpers
- [ ] Add role checks to all protected UI components

### Integration Points
- [ ] Ensure role permissions work with all existing features
- [ ] Update organization switching to handle role changes
- [ ] Integrate with upcoming invitation system

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for enhanced user management procedures
- [ ] Write integration tests for role-based access control
- [ ] Test organization switching with different roles
- [ ] Test permission enforcement in UI components

## Progress Updates

**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task updated to build upon UserOrganization model from Task 1
**Blockers**: Depends on TASK-001 completion
**Next Steps**: Wait for Organization Management implementation

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

This task builds upon the foundation established in Task 1 where the UserOrganization model was created. The focus here is on implementing the business logic around roles and permissions rather than database schema changes.

Key considerations:
- UserOrganization model already exists from Task 1
- Focus on implementing role-based business logic and UI
- Ensure consistent permission enforcement across the application
- Make role management intuitive for organization admins
- Consider audit logging for role changes
- Plan for future role expansion (more granular permissions)
