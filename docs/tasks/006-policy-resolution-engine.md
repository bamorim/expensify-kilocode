## Description

Implement a policy resolution engine that determines the applicable policy for any user/category combination. The engine must handle policy precedence rules, provide debugging capabilities, and integrate seamlessly with the expense submission workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Policy resolution algorithm with clear precedence rules
- [ ] tRPC procedure for resolving policies for users
- [ ] Policy debugging tool showing all matching policies
- [ ] Policy precedence explanation interface
- [ ] Integration with expense submission workflow
- [ ] Performance optimization for policy resolution
- [ ] Comprehensive tests for resolution scenarios
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases

## TODOs

### Core Resolution Logic
- [ ] Design policy resolution algorithm
- [ ] Implement policy matching logic
- [ ] Implement precedence calculation (user-specific > org-wide)
- [ ] Handle policy conflicts and edge cases
- [ ] Create policy resolution service

### API Implementation
- [ ] Create resolvePolicy tRPC procedure
- [ ] Implement getPolicyDebugInfo procedure
- [ ] Add policy validation procedures
- [ ] Create policy preview functionality
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging

### Debugging Tools
- [ ] Create policy debugging interface
- [ ] Show all applicable policies with scores
- [ ] Explain final policy selection
- [ ] Display policy conflict resolution
- [ ] Create policy testing tool for admins

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement policy caching strategy
- [ ] Optimize database queries for policy lookup
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create efficient policy indexing

### Integration Points
- [ ] Integrate with expense submission workflow
- [ ] Provide policy context to expense forms
- [ ] Add policy validation to expense creation
- [ ] Ensure policy changes don't affect existing expenses

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for resolution algorithm
- [ ] Write integration tests for policy scenarios
- [ ] Test policy conflict resolution
- [ ] Test performance with large policy sets
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

## Progress Updates

### 2025-10-26 - Architect
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task created based on PRD requirements
**Blockers**: Depends on TASK-005 completion
**Next Steps**: Wait for Policy Management implementation

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

The policy resolution engine is a critical component that ensures consistent policy application across the system. It must be both powerful and transparent to help users understand why certain policies apply.

Key considerations:
- Resolution must be deterministic and predictable
- Performance is critical for real-time expense validation
- Debugging tools should help admins understand policy behavior
- Need to handle complex policy hierarchies efficiently
- Policy resolution should be auditable for compliance
- Consider caching frequently resolved policies
- Resolution logic must be thoroughly tested for edge cases
