## Description

Implement a comprehensive policy management system that allows organization admins to define reimbursement policies per category. The system must support organization-wide and user-specific policies with clear precedence rules and auto-approval configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Policy model supporting organization-wide and user-specific policies
- [ ] tRPC procedures for policy CRUD operations
- [ ] Policy configuration UI with intuitive forms
- [ ] Support for maximum amounts per period
- [ ] Auto-approval vs manual review configuration
- [ ] Policy list and management interface
- [ ] Proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Tests for all policy operations

## TODOs

### Database Schema
- [ ] Create Policy model with required fields
- [ ] Add policy type (organization/user) and target fields
- [ ] Create PolicyLimit model for amount/period configuration
- [ ] Add proper indexes for policy queries
- [ ] Create database migration
- [ ] Add constraints for policy uniqueness

### API Implementation
- [ ] Create policy tRPC router
- [ ] Implement createPolicy procedure (admin only)
- [ ] Implement getPolicies procedure (org members)
- [ ] Implement updatePolicy procedure (admin only)
- [ ] Implement deletePolicy procedure (admin only)
- [ ] Implement getPolicyForUser procedure (for resolution engine)
- [ ] Add admin authorization middleware

### Policy Configuration
- [ ] Design policy configuration schema
- [ ] Implement period-based limits (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- [ ] Add auto-approval vs manual review flags
- [ ] Create policy validation logic
- [ ] Handle policy conflicts and overlaps

### UI Components
- [ ] Create policy list component with filtering
- [ ] Create policy form (create/edit) with complex fields
- [ ] Create policy target selection (organization/users)
- [ ] Create policy limit configuration interface
- [ ] Add policy management to organization settings
- [ ] Implement policy preview/summary view

### Integration Points
- [ ] Prepare for Policy Resolution Engine integration
- [ ] Ensure policies are available in expense submission
- [ ] Add policy validation in expense workflow

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for policy procedures
- [ ] Write integration tests for policy workflows
- [ ] Test policy validation and constraints
- [ ] Test admin authorization enforcement
- [ ] Test policy conflict scenarios

## Progress Updates

### 2025-10-26 - Architect
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task created based on PRD requirements
**Blockers**: Depends on TASK-001, TASK-002, and TASK-004 completion
**Next Steps**: Wait for Organization, User Management, and Categories implementation

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

Policy management is a critical feature that controls expense behavior throughout the system. The design must support both simple and complex policy configurations while maintaining clarity for admins.

Key considerations:
- Policies need clear precedence rules (user-specific > organization-wide)
- Policy configuration should be intuitive for non-technical admins
- Need to handle policy conflicts gracefully
- Policies must be properly validated before saving
- Consider providing policy templates for common scenarios
- Policy changes should not affect already submitted expenses
- Need clear documentation for policy behavior
