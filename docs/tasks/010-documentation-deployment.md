## Notes

Proper documentation and deployment setup are critical for the long-term success and maintainability of the expense management system. This task ensures the system is production-ready and well-documented.

Key considerations:
- Documentation should be clear and comprehensive
- Deployment should be automated and reliable
- Monitoring should provide visibility into system health
- Security should be prioritized throughout deployment
- Consider scalability requirements in deployment configuration
- Ensure disaster recovery procedures are documented
- Make onboarding new developers as smooth as possible
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
